Random fields on complex geometries
---
This code implements two strategies to sample random fields on complex geometries. The first strategy is based on a stochastic PDE, (SPDE folder) while the second on a truncated KL expansion (geoKL folder).

More information can be found in the poster and in the proceeding paper for the conference *Functional Imaging and Modelling of the Heart 2019* held in Bordeaux on June 6th to 8th ([website](https://fimh2019.sciencesconf.org)).
